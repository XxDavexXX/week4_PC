First, I carefully reviewed the design and functional requirements of the program you specified in your question.

Based on those requirements, I identified the main program components that would be needed: a DiaryEntry class to represent a journal entry, and a Diary class to handle the list of entries and related operations.

I started by creating the DiaryEntry class. This class has three main attributes: prompt (the question or prompt), response (the user's response), and date (the date of the input). I defined a constructor for the class that initializes these attributes.

Next, I created the Diary class. This class has a list called entries that will store all the journal entries. Also, I added methods to perform the required operations, such as adding a new entry, displaying all entries, saving the journal to a file, and loading the journal from a file.

I have implemented the add_entry method in the Diary class. Within this method, I created a list of predefined questions or prompts. Using the random.choice function, I selected a random question from the list and displayed it to the user. I then prompted the user to enter their answer and created a DiaryEntry instance with the question, answer, and today's date. Finally, I added the entry to the entries list of the Diary class.

To show all the entries, I implemented the show_entries method in the Diary class. This method iterates over the entries list and displays the date, question, and answer for each entry.

Next, I implemented the save_to_file and load_from_file methods in the Diary class to save and load the journal from a file respectively. In the save_to_file method, I opened the user-specified file in write mode and iterated through all the entries saving the date, question, and answer on separate lines. In the load_from_file method, I opened the user-specified file in read mode and read the lines corresponding to each entry, creating DiaryEntry instances and adding them to the entries list of the Diary class.

Finally, I implemented the main function that contains the main loop of the program. In this loop, I displayed a menu with the different options available and asked the user to choose an option. Based on the selected option, I called the corresponding method on the instance of the Diary class.

Added a condition to exit the main loop when the user selects the exit option.
